## Bugs
1. Language change doesn't work, If change the language to Deutsch, still I see almost all the text and buttons in English
2. After changing the language to Deutsch and When I closed the app and opened the Expense & Income buttons disappeared (replaced with - & +)
3. Since I use the Freemium  version, If I delete a category by mistake, I cannot add it back (The validation Message is not clear,
   While deleting the category nowhere does it mention that I can not add the category again)
4. Changing currency doesn't convert reported records value from the previous to the new currency. It just replaces the currency symbol (Ex: $ with â‚¬)
